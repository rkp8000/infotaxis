ID: make_geom_config_group_wind_tunnel_matched
TYPE: data_generating
Looks up all starting positions from wind tunnel data and converts them to infotaxis-discretized starting indexes.

ID: generate_wind_tunnel_matched_trials
TYPE: data_generating
Generate a set of trajectories inside a theoretical wind tunnel using starting positions and trajectory durations taken
from actual wind tunnel data.

ID: extend_wind_tunnel_matched_geom_configs_with_trajectory_ids
TYPE: data_cleaning
Go through wind tunnel database and note actual trajectory ids associated with each geom_config.

ID: generate_wind_tunnel_matched_trials_one_for_one
TYPE: data_generating
Generate a set of trajectories inside a theoretical wind tunnel using starting positions and trajectory durations taken
from actual wind tunnel data. Like 'generate_wind_tunnel_matched_trials', but making sure to generate one infotaxis trial for every wind tunnel trial.

ID: make_wind_tunnel_discretized_geom_configs
TYPE: data_generating
Use specified environment discretization to calculate the starting position idxs and discretized trial durations and save them in the database.

ID: generate_discretized_wind_tunnel_trajectory_copies
TYPE: data_generating
Load all wind tunnel trajectories and make discretized copies of them for direct comparison with infotaxis-begotten trajectories. This requires make_wind_tunnel_discretized_geom_configs to be run first so that the correct geom_configs can be bound to discretized trajectories.

ID: fix_collimated_plume_thresholds_of_odor_none_and_afterodor_in_db
TYPE: data_editing
Go through all of the plumes corresponding to the none and afterodor simulations and change their threshold values to -1, since these weren't actually stored correctly in the plume class.

ID: generate_wind_tunnel_discretized_matched_trials_one_for_one
TYPE: data_generating
Create one trial for each wind tunnel trajectory. Use the geometrical configurations calculated by discretizing trajectories.

ID: generate_position_histograms
TYPE: data_analysis
Create histograms of position for one or more simulations.

ID: delete_wind_tunnel_discretized_copies_simulations_because_they_used_wrong_tau
TYPE: data_removing
Delete all the simulations and the trials that were made before because they used the wrong tau. These will be replaced by running the script 'generate_discretized_wind_tunnel_trajectory_copies'.

ID: make_displacement_total_histograms
TYPE: data_analysis
Create histograms of total displacement from initial starting location for a set of trajectories.

ID: make_displacement_after_n_timesteps_histograms
TYPE: data_analysis
Create histograms of displacement from initial starting location to location after a certain number of timesteps have passed for a set of trials.

ID: make_take_off_position_histograms
TYPE: data_analysis
Create a 3D histogram of the take-off positions (discretized) of all the insects.

ID: make_segment_groups_and_segments
TYPE: data_analysis
Create segment groups according to when the insects cross the plume.

ID: make_exit_triggered_heading_ensembles
TYPE: data_analysis
Go through sets of trials and save the mean, std, sem, and number of data points in a heading time-series triggered on exiting the plume.
